6. Reasons for finding a job and changing jobs
(1)Seraku
- Seraku hired a new graduate with no programming experience as a Data Scientist;
- I certainly gained experience in programming: Python and R and IT tools: SQL and BI, as well as in Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis;
- After that, I offered to move to the in-house development department, but I was rejected;
- As a result, I decided to change jobs because I wanted to go to the upstream process of Data Science.
(2)EDIX
- EDIX promised to leave me the Lead Data Scientist from the beginning and go to the upstream process of Data Science in the job vacancies and interview explanations;
- In fact, I worked as a Technical Advisor of Data Science as SES(System Engineering Service);
- However, I realized that SES could not develop and propose Data Science Projects on its own, so I decided to change jobs again.
